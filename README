This ROMS trunk includes modified NPZD (NPPZD) model used in Choi et al. (2023).
The model was used to study population dynamics of prey avoidance and resolves two different phytoplankton, which have different nutrient uptake and prey avoidance ability, and one zooplankton group.

Simple test problem (including instruction) will be updated soon.
